"# CoffeeShop" 

This project is based off of the template provided for a coffee shop website. Using the template, I was able to create a mobile-first design using the following CSS and JavaScript features:
- A navigation menu the opens and closes with a hamburger icon.
- The navigation menu changes, depending on the size of the viewport between a hamburger menu, and a standard nav menu.
- Used Flexbox to organize content on screen. Depending on the size of the viewport, content in the menu will either be one or two columns and items will change flex-direction from column to row.
- A contact form was created using JavaScript to validate that the email was entered in the correct format, and then displays the users input back to them on screen.
